We will use grpc

Our initial plan on the file structure is
CS2620_scale/
├── main.py
├── virtual_machine.py
├── distributed_system.proto
├── notebook.txt
├── requirements.txt
└── generated/
    ├── distributed_system_pb2.py
    └── distributed_system_pb2_grpc.py

First we write .proto file to define the messaging interface
Then virtual_machine.py that uses the messages
Then main.py that starts up the virtual machines and runs them for the specified duration

After first implementation, we see that racing conditions occur, when we stop the program.
This is because we forcefully close the file while the VMs still try to write to it.
We will ignore this for now.
